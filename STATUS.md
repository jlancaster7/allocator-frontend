# Order Allocation System - Frontend Status Report

## üéâ All Core Features Complete!
The frontend application is now feature-complete with all three wizard steps implemented.

## ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Login Flow**
   - Login page displays correctly
   - Authentication works with `demo_user` / `demo_password`
   - JWT tokens are stored and used for API calls
   - Successful redirect to allocation workbench after login

2. **Navigation & Layout**
   - App header with user info
   - Logout functionality
   - Protected routes (redirect to login if not authenticated)

3. **Allocation Workbench - Step 1: Order Entry** ‚úÖ
   - Security search component with debounced autocomplete
   - Order entry form with full validation
   - Buy/Sell radio selection
   - Quantity formatting with thousand separators
   - Settlement date picker (T+2 default)
   - Optional price override

4. **Allocation Workbench - Step 2: Method Selection** ‚úÖ
   - Portfolio group multi-select (PUBLICPRE, BIG6, DP-LB-USD, OPNIC)
   - Three allocation methods:
     - Pro-Rata (NAV-based)
     - Custom Weights (manual % entry with validation)
     - Minimum Dispersion (with tolerance slider and metric selection)
   - Dynamic UI based on selected method
   - Account fetching from selected portfolio groups

5. **Allocation Workbench - Step 3: Preview & Commit** ‚úÖ
   - Summary cards (total allocated, rate, accounts, unallocated)
   - AG-Grid Enterprise data table with:
     - Pinned columns for account info
     - Formatted numbers and currency
     - Pre/Post trade metrics
     - Color-coded ASD changes
     - Excel export functionality
   - Dispersion metrics visualization with Recharts
   - Warning and error display
   - Commit confirmation dialog with comments
   - Loading states and error handling

## üîß Backend Integration Status
All components are ready and waiting for backend endpoints:
1. **Security Search** - `/securities/search` endpoint
2. **Portfolio Groups** - `/portfolio-groups` endpoint (returns mock data via our handlers)
3. **Allocation Preview** - `/allocations/preview` endpoint
4. **Commit Allocation** - `/allocations/{id}/commit` endpoint

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Achievements
- **AG-Grid Enterprise** integrated with license key support
- **Material-UI** theme customization
- **Redux Toolkit** with RTK Query for API calls
- **TypeScript** strict mode with proper typing
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **React Hook Form** with Yup validation
- All components follow best practices and design patterns

## üìã Remaining Nice-to-Haves
1. Toast notifications for user feedback
2. Order modification/cancellation features
3. Additional test coverage
4. Dark mode support
5. Keyboard shortcuts

## üîó Useful Links
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000/v1
- Swagger Docs: http://localhost:5000/docs

## üìù Notes
- AG-Grid Enterprise key configured via environment variable
- All mock data removed - components use backend API only
- Form validation is comprehensive across all steps
- Export to Excel functionality ready with AG-Grid Enterprise

## üêõ Recent Issues Fixed
1. **Auth Token Expiry** - Fixed critical bug where `allocationApi` wasn't using the auth interceptor
2. **UI Improvements** - Enhanced SecuritySearch dropdown width and PortfolioGroup selector display
3. **API Contract Mismatch** - Identified backend deviation from agreed API contract for portfolio groups endpoint

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Backend Issues
- ~~**Portfolio Groups Endpoint**: Backend returns `id/name` instead of contracted `group_id/group_name`~~ ‚úÖ FIXED
- ~~Frontend has been made resilient to handle both formats until backend is fixed~~ ‚úÖ FIXED

## üöÄ New Features Added (Enhanced Custom Weights)
1. **Enhanced Allocation Mode** 
   - Toggle between legacy percentage-only and new enhanced mode
   - Support for three allocation types per account:
     - Dollar Amount (e.g., $2,000,000)
     - Percentage (e.g., 25%)
     - Quantity (e.g., 500,000 bonds)
   - Mix different types within a single allocation

2. **Remainder Handling**
   - Distribute unallocated bonds via:
     - Pro-rata (by NAV)
     - Equal split
     - None (default)
   - Allow partial allocation option for constrained scenarios

3. **Enhanced Preview Display**
   - New columns showing requested type and value
   - Allocation source tracking (Direct/Remainder/Pro-Rata)
   - Clear visibility of what was requested vs. allocated

4. **Smart Validation**
   - Type-specific validation (percentages ‚â§ 100%, quantities ‚â§ order quantity)
   - Dynamic input formatting with currency/percentage symbols
   - Real-time feedback on allocation totals

## üìä Implementation Details
- **New Components**: `AllocationTypeSelector` for type selection UI
- **New Types**: Full TypeScript support via `src/types/allocation.ts`
- **Backward Compatible**: Legacy percentage weights still fully supported
- **API Ready**: Uses the enhanced `CustomWeightsParameters` schema from API contract

## üìà Latest Updates (v1.1.1)
- **NAV Display**: Added Net Asset Value column to allocation preview grid
  - Essential for verifying pro-rata allocations
  - Shows account sizes alongside allocation amounts
  - Backend now includes NAV in allocation response
